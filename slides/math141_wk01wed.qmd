:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

-   In this course, you will learn how to think critically with data by engaging in the entire data analysis process.

-   Most of our time will be spent in the **Exploration and Visualization**  and **Modeling and Inference** steps, but we will spend some time in each cog!
    - First ~3 weeks in **Exploration and Visualization**
    - Next ~3 weeks in **Modeling**
    - Final ~half of the course in **Inference**

## Course Climate 

We expect everyone in this class to strive to foster a learning environment that is equitable, inclusive, and welcoming. If you experience any barriers to learning, please come to Professor Grayson White or a college administrator with your concerns.

<br>

**Code of Conduct**:

We expect all members of Math 141 to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We expect everyone to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, inclusive, and healthy community of learners. You can contribute to a positive learning environment by demonstrating empathy and kindness, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, and giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.[^1]

[^1]: This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.0.

## Late Work

::: {.nonincremental}

:::{.fragment .fade-up}

-   **Labs**: up to 4 extensions days can be used throughout the semester.
    - e.g., 1 additional day for 4 labs, 4 additional days for 1 lab, ...
    - rounding days up
    
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-up}

-   **Homeworks**: no late homework assignments are accepted, but the lowest three scores will be dropped.

:::

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

::::: {.columns}
:::  {.column width="60%"}

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others are being used to generate code, analyze data, and much more. However, learning to think critically about a problem at hand, and engaging with your peers, tutors, and instructors when not understanding a concept or question are integral components of a liberal arts education. Further, a key goal of this course is for you to learn how to thoughtfully, ethically, and independently extract knowledge from data and engage in statistical reasoning. Therefore, the use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and others, are strictly prohibited in any stage of the work process for this course. If you have questions about whether a tool is allowed for this course, ask the Instructor before using it.

# Course or syllabus questions? 

## Math 141 is about developing our **statistical thinking** skills. {.center}

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up .midi}
What is **statistical thinking**?
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up .midi}
It is not the same as mathematical thinking.
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up .midi}
Let's discover what **statistical thinking** is through some examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data in Math 141

Will use a wide-range of **real** and **relevant** data examples

-   I understand that some of these topics have likely had profound impacts on your lives.

-   We will focus class time on the key course objectives but will use these current topics to empower ourselves and to see how we can productively participate with data.

# Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence {.smaller}

-   In May of 2020, the Georgia Department of Public Health posted the following graph:

::: {.fragment .midi}
![](img/GAcovid.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}
:::

-   At a quick first glance, what story does the Georgia Department of Public Health graph appear to be telling?

-   What is misleading about the Georgia Department of Public Health graph? How could we fix this issue?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence {.smaller}

-   After public outcry, the Georgia Department of Public Health said they made a mistake and posted the following updated graph:

::: {.fragment .midi}
![](img/GAcovid2.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%"}
:::

-   How do your conclusions about COVID-19 cases in Georgia change when now interpreting this new graph?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence {.smaller}

Alberto Cairo, a journalist and designer, created the second graph of the Georgia COVID-19 data:

::: {.fragment .midi}
![](img/GAcovid2.jpg){width="40%"} ![](img/GAcovid_cairo.png){width="40%"}
:::

-   A key principle of data visualization is to **"help the viewer make meaningful comparisons"**.

-   What comparisons are made easy by the lefthand graph? What about by the righthand graph?

-   From these graphs, can we get an accurate estimate of the COVID prevalence in these Georgian counties over this two week period?
