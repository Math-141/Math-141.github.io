## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy


::: blockquote

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others are being used to generate code, analyze data, and much more. However, learning to think critically about a problem at hand, and engaging with your peers, tutors, and instructors when not understanding a concept or question are integral components of a liberal arts education. Further, a key goal of this course is for you to learn how to thoughtfully, ethically, and independently extract knowledge from data and engage in statistical reasoning. Therefore, the use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and others, are strictly prohibited in any stage of the work process for this course. If you have questions about whether a tool is allowed for this course, ask the Instructor before using it.

:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

```



- Why this policy?




## Engagement

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br> <br>

![](img/elephant.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

-   Being **actively present** is key.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   During lecture and lab, remove distractions.
    -   When we are on our computers, close email, social media, news, etc.
    -   Hide your phone.
-   I have high expectations but know that all of you (regardless of your stats, math, or computing background) have the ability to meet them.

What is **statistical thinking**?
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up .midi}
It is not the same as mathematical thinking.

::: {.fragment .fade-up .midi}
Let's discover what **statistical thinking** is through some examples.

-   I understand that some of these topics have likely had profound impacts on your lives.

-   We will focus class time on the key course objectives but will use these current topics to empower ourselves and to see how we can productively participate with data.

# Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence

-   In May of 2020, the Georgia Department of Public Health posted the following graph:

::: {.fragment .midi}
![](img/GAcovid.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}
:::

-   At a quick first glance, what story does the graph appear to be telling?

-   What is misleading about the graph? How could we fix this issue?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence

-   After public outcry, the Georgia Department of Public Health said they made a mistake and posted the following updated graph:

::: {.fragment .midi}
![](img/GAcovid2.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%"}
:::

-   How do your conclusions about COVID-19 cases in Georgia change when now interpreting this new graph?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence 

Alberto Cairo, a journalist and designer, created the second graph of the Georgia COVID-19 data:

::: {.fragment .midi}
![](img/GAcovid2.jpg){width="40%"} ![](img/GAcovid_cairo.png){width="40%"}
:::

-   A key principle of data visualization is to **"help the viewer make meaningful comparisons"**.

-   What comparisons are made easy by the lefthand graph? What about by the righthand graph?

-   From these graphs, can we get an accurate estimate of the COVID prevalence in these Georgian counties over this two week period?


## Statistical Thinking

-   About developing **reasoning** (not just learning definitions and formulae).

-   Statistical thinking requires **judgment** that takes time to develop.

    -   Will see **examples** and **practice** applying statistical thinking throughout the course.

-   Developing our statistical thinking skills will allow us to soundly **extract knowledge from data**!

## Data Frames

Data in **spreadsheet**-like format where:

-   Rows = Observations/cases

-   Columns = Variables

```{r}
#| echo: false
# pak::pak("simonpcouch/detectors")
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(detectors)

detectors %>%
  mutate(ID = row_number()) %>%
  relocate(ID) %>%
  select(-document_id, -prompt) %>%
  head() %>%

  kable() %>%   
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "bordered", "striped", "compact"),
                font_size = 32)

```

-   Data from **GPT Detectors Are Biased Against Non-Native English Writers.** *Weixin Liang*, *Mert Yuksekgonul*, *Yining Mao*, *Eric Wu*, *James Zou.* [CellPress Patterns](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2023.100779) and available in the `R` package `detectors`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Frames

```{r}
#| echo: false

detectors %>%
  mutate(ID = row_number()) %>%
  relocate(ID) %>%
  select(-document_id, -prompt) %>%
  head() %>%

  kable() %>%   
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "bordered", "striped", "compact"),
                font_size = 32)

```

Rows = Observations/cases

**What are the cases? What does each row represent?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Frames

```{r}
#| echo: false

detectors %>%
  mutate(ID = row_number()) %>%
  relocate(ID) %>%
  select(-document_id, -prompt) %>%
  head() %>%

  kable() %>%   
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "bordered", "striped", "compact"),
                font_size = 32)

```

Columns = Variables

**Variables**: Describe characteristics of the observations

-   **Quantitative**: Numerical in nature

-   **Categorical**: Values are categories

-   **Identification**: Uniquely identify each case

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| echo: false

detectors %>%
  mutate(ID = row_number()) %>%
  relocate(ID) %>%
  select(-document_id, -prompt) %>%
  head() %>%

  kable() %>%   
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "bordered", "striped", "compact"),
                font_size = 32)

```

Every time you get a new dataset, spend time exploring the variables.

Example questions:

-   Is each variable capturing the desired information?

-   For categorical variables, what are the categories? Do those categories adequately represent that variable?

-   For quantitative variables, what values are possible? Were the data rounded or binned? Are those values actually encoding categories? What are the units of measurement?
