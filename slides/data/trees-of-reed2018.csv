American Sweetgum,Liquidambar styraciflua,Liquidambar,Hamamelidaceae,"This deciduous tree is distinguished by its prickly seed balls and beautiful fall colors. The Sweetgum got its name because the cut bark exudes a sweet, fragrant liquid used to make perfumes. It often is mistaken for a maple because the leaves are similar. The Sweetgum leaves are lustrous and bright green above and paler beneath. The wood of this tree is used to make furniture.",http://blogs.reed.edu/trees/files/2013/08/IMG_0388-american-sweetgum-e1411081979730.jpg,45.47938732,-122.6295769,Liquidambar styraciflua

American Sycamore,Platanus occidentalis,Platanus,Platanaceae,"Also known as the Buttonwood, Buttonball tree, and American Planetree, this tree is native to the eastern U.S., south to northern Florida and Texas. Leaves are 3 and sometimes 5-lobed, flat medium green in summer; fall color is tan to brown. The hard wood of the American Sycamore is often used for butcher blocks. Its bark is distinctive: on older trees it peels and flakes, leaving a lighter underbark. This tree can reach enormous heights of 150 feet in its native habitat and up to 100 feet in the city. It is one parent of the London Plane tree.",http://blogs.reed.edu/trees/files/2013/09/PLOC1_lg.jpg,45.47949453,-122.6337351,Platanus occidentalis

The Europeans have grown, appreciated, and selected superior forms of this tree, while some Americans treat it as a weed. A native of the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, it has naturalized in much of the Pacific Northwest. Its wood is highly resistant to decay and is often used for fenceposts. In addition to the trees shown on these maps, there is a row of old black locusts along the north edge of the Reed canyon, between the footbridge and the springs.

A native of the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, it has naturalized in much of the Pacific Northwest. Its wood is highly resistant to decay and is often used for fenceposts. In addition to the trees shown on these maps, there is a row of old black locusts along the north edge of the Reed canyon, between the footbridge and the springs.

Typically, it has a straight trunk, and the dark green leaves are almost square in shape. The beautiful flowers are yellow-green and shaped like tulips, but difficult to see because they blend with the foliage.
