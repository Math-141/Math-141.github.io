## Goals for Today

-   Finish up data collection ideas
-   Discuss drawing conclusions from our sample and types of studies

# Data Collection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who are the data supposed to represent?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who are the data supposed to represent?

![](img/week4.006.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

**Key questions:**

-   What evidence is there that the **respondents** are **representative** of the **population**?
-   Who is present? Who is absent?
-   Who is overrepresented? Who is underrepresented?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Nonresponse bias

![](img/sampling.003.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

**Nonresponse bias**: The respondents are **systematically** different from the non-respondents for the variables of interest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Come Back to Literary Digest Example

Of the 10 million people surveyed, more than 2.4 million responded with 57% indicating that they would vote for Republican Alf Landon in the upcoming presidential election instead of the current President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

<br>

**Non-response bias**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tackling Nonresponse bias

![](img/sampling.003.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

-   Use **multiple modes** (mail, phone, in-person) and **multiple attempts** for reaching sampled cases.

-   Explore key demographic variables to see how respondents and non-respondents vary.

-   Take a survey stats course to learn how to create survey weights to adjust for potential nonresponse bias.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Is Bigger Always Better?

![](img/sampling.004.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

For our **Literary Digest Example**, Gallup predicted Roosevelt would win based on a survey of **50,000** people (instead of 2.4 million).

> "Without taking data quality into account, population inferences with Big Data are subject to a Big Data Paradox: the more the data, the surer we fool ourselves." -- Xiao-Li Meng
:::
:::::

**Example:**

-   During Spring of 2021, Delphi-Facebook estimated vaccine uptake at 70% and U.S. Census estimated it at 67%.

-   The CDC reported it to be 53%.

::: fragment
And, once we learn about **quantifying uncertainty**, we will see that large sample sizes produce very small measures of uncertainty.

> "If you have the resources, invest in data quality far more than you invest in data quantity. Bad-quality data is essentially wiping out the power you think you have. That's always been a problem, but it's magnified now because we have big data." -- Xiao-Li Meng

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Thoughts on Sampling

-   **Random** sampling is important to ensure the sample is **representative** of the population.

    -   Word we will use: **generalizability**

-   Representativeness isn't about **size**.

    -   Small random samples will tend to be more representative than large non-random samples.

-   However, I bet most samples you will encounter **won't** have arisen from a random mechanism.

-   How do we draw conclusions about the population from **non-random samples**?

    -   Determine if your sampled cases (and respondents) are systematically different from the non-sampled cases (and non-respondents) for the variables you care about.
    -   Adjust your population of interest.




# Now let's shift our discussion to the conclusions we can draw from the sample we have.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Typical Analysis Goals

**Descriptive**: Want to estimate quantities related to the population.

→ *How many trees are in Alaska?*

::: fragment
**Predictive**: Want to predict the value of a variable.

→ *Can I use remotely sensed data to predict forest types in Alaska?*
:::

::: fragment
**Causal**: Want to determine if changes in a variable cause changes in another variable.

→ *Are insects causing the increased mortality rates for pinyon-juniper woodlands?*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Typical Analysis Goals

For these goals will differentiate between the roles of the variables:

-   **Response variable**: Variable I want to better understand

-   **Explanatory/predictor variables**: Variables I think might explain/predict the response variable

::: fragment
→ *How many trees are in Alaska?*

→ *Can I use remotely sensed data to predict forest types in Alaska?*

→ *Are insects causing the increased mortality rates for pinyon-juniper woodlands?*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Mechanism for Causal Goal

**Random assignment**: Cases are randomly assigned to categories of the **explanatory variable**

-   If the data were collected using **random assignment**, then can determine if the explanatory variable **causes** changes in the response variable.

::: fragment
**Example**: [COVID Vaccine Trials](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/experimental-coronavirus-vaccine-highly-effective)

To study the effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273), researchers carried out a study on over 30,000 adult volunteers with no known previous COVID-19 infection. Volunteers were randomly assigned to either receive two doses of the vaccine or two shots of saline. The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 94% lower in those who received the vaccine than those who did not.

**Question**: Why does random assignment allow us to conclude that this vaccine was effective at preventing (early strains of) COVID-19?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Careful with Non-Random Assignment Data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
We have data on the number of Methodist ministers in New England and the number of barrels of rum imported into Boston each year. The data range from 1860 to 1940.

-   Should we conclude that ministers drink a lot of rum? Or maybe that rum drinking encourages church attendance?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false


library(Lock5withR)
ggplot(data = MinistersRum, mapping = aes(x = Ministers, 
                                          y = Rum)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 4, color = "green4")
```

:::::

-   **Confounding variable**: A third variable that is associated with both the explanatory variable and the response variable.

-   Unclear if the explanatory variable or the confounder (or some other variable) is causing changes in the response.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Causal Inference

-   **Spurious relationship**: Two variables are associated but not causally related
    -   In the age of big data, lots of good examples [out there](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).

→ *"Correlation does not imply causation."*

→ *"Correlation does not imply not causation."*
:::

-   **Causal inference**: Methods for finding causal relationships even when the data were collected without random assignment.
      -   We are lucky to have **two** causal inference experts in our department! 
      -   **Lenny Wainstein** and **Megan Ayers** (joining this spring) do research on causal inference. 

# Types of Studies

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Observational Studies

-   A study in which the researchers don't actively control the value of any variable, but simply observe the values as they naturally exist.

-   **Example**: Hand washing study

    -   To estimate what percent of people in the US wash their hands after using a public restroom, researchers pretended to comb their hair while observing 6000 people in public restrooms throughout the United States. They found that 85% of the people who were observed washed their hands after going to the bathroom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## (Randomized) Experiment

-   A study in which the researcher actively controls one or more of the explanatory variables through random assignment.

-   **Example**: COVID Trial

-   Common features:

    -   **Control** group that gets no treatment or a standard treatment
    -   **Placebo**: A fake treatment to control for the **placebo effect** where if people believe they are receiving a treatment, they may experience the desired effect regardless of whether the treatment is any good.
    -   **Blinding**: When the subjects and/or researchers don't know the explanatory group assignments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Thoughts on Data Collection Goals

-   Random assignment allows you to explore **causal** relationships between your explanatory variables and the predictor variables because the randomization makes the explanatory groups roughly similar.

-   How do we draw causal conclusions from studies without random assignment?

    -   With extreme care! Try to **control** for all possible confounding variables.
    -   Discuss the associations/correlations you found. Use domain knowledge to address potentially causal links.
    -   Take more stats to learn more about causal inference.

-   But also consider the goals of your analysis. Often the research question isn't causal.

-   **Bottom Line:** We often have to use imperfect data to make decisions.
