# Discussion of midterm results

## Midterm make-up credit

If you scored less than 80% on the midterm you have the opportunity to get some points back. Parameters:

-   You can get up to 50% of your missed points back (up to an 80% total score on the midterm).
    - **Example:** If you got a 70% on the midterm, you can get up to an 80% on the midterm, but if you got a 50% on the midterm you can get up to a 75% on the midterm. 
-   For each question part you can get half the points you missed.
    - **Example:** If you got a 3 / 5 on Question 2 part (a), an entirely correct solution submitted to me on the midterm makeups will score you a 4 / 5 on Question 2 part (a).
-   All rules of the midterm still apply, but now: 
    (1) you have no time pressure, and 
    (2) you can come to my (Grayson's) office hours to discuss questions you are stuck on, but no other office hours or individual tutoring.
-   Midterm corrects are due on Gradescope by Sunday 11/9 (11 days from now) at 8pm. 



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final exam info

-   We'll be having our **written** final exam in person during the final exam time slot: 

-   Wednesday, December 17th from 6pm - 9pm in Vollum Lecture Hall. 


-   Oral exam details TBD.

## Statistical Inference

::::: columns
::: column
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/week4.005.jpeg")
```
:::

::: column
**Goal**: Draw conclusions about the population based on a sample.

**Main Flavors**:

-   Estimating numerical quantities.
-   Testing conjectures.
:::
:::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Does Extrasensory Perception (ESP) exist?

:::::: columns
::: column
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Daryl Bem and Ben Honorton"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Bem_Honorton.png")
```
:::

:::: column
Bem and Honorton conducted extrasensory perception studies:

::: nonincremental
-   A "sender" randomly chooses an object out of 4 possible objects and sends that information to a "receiver".
-   The "receiver" is then given a set of 4 possible objects and they must decide which one most resembles the object sent to them.
:::

Out of 329 trials, the "receivers" correctly identified the object 106 times.
::::
::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ESP Example

Let's consider the following questions:


a.  If ESP does not exist and the "receivers" are guessing, how often would we expect them to be correct?

b.  For each sample (set of 329 trials), do we expect the proportion of correct guesses to be equal? Why or why not?

c.  Is it possible to randomly guess correctly 106 out of 329 times (i.e., 32% of the time)?

d.  How unusual is it to guess correctly 106 out of 329 times if ESP doesn't exist?


::: fragment
To help us answer d., we need a **sampling distribution** for the sample proportion where **we assume the "receivers" were purely guessing!**

## Sampling Distribution of a Statistic

:::::: columns
:::: column
**Steps for (Approximate) Distribution:**

::: nonincremental
(1) Decide on a sample size, $n$.

(2) Randomly select a sample of size $n$ from the population.

(3) Compute the sample statistic.

(4) Put the sample back in.

(5) Repeat Steps (2) - (4) many (1000+) times.

## Sampling Distribution Under No ESP

**Steps for (Approximate) Distribution:**

::: nonincremental
(1) Decide on a sample size, $n$.

(2) Randomly select a sample of size $n$ from the population.
:::

```{r}
library(mosaic)
rflip(n = 329, prob = 0.25)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sampling Distribution Under No ESP


::: nonincremental
(3) Compute the sample statistic.
:::

```{r}
rflip(n = 329, prob = 0.25, summarize = TRUE)
```


:::: fragment
::: nonincremental
(4) Put the sample back in.

(5) Repeat Steps (2) - (4) many (1000+) times.
:::

```{r}
guessing_samp_dist <- do(1000)*rflip(n = 329, prob = 0.25)
guessing_samp_dist
```
::::


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sampling Distribution Under No ESP

```{r}
#| output-location: column

ggplot(data = guessing_samp_dist,
       mapping = aes(x = prop)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white",
                 bins = 20)
```

What value should our sampling distribution be centered around if the receivers are just guessing?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sampling Distribution Under No ESP 

::: nonincremental
-   How do the study results compare to the sampling distribution under no ESP?
    -   How unusual is it to guess correctly 106 out of 329 times if ESP doesn't exist?
:::

```{r}
#| output-location: column

p_hat <- 106 / 329

ggplot(data = guessing_samp_dist,
       mapping = aes(x = prop)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white",
                 bins = 20) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_hat,
             color = "orange",
             size = 2)
```

-   Do Bem and Honorton have evidence that ESP exists?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Do Reedies Have ESP?

:::::: columns
:::: column
In pairs:

::: nonincremental
-   Decide who is going to be the sender and who is going to be the receiver.

-   **Sender:** Think of one of these images.

-   **Receiver:** Guess which image the sender was thinking of.

-   Now switch roles and do it again!

-   Once you have both played each role, each person should add a tally mark on the chalkboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Do Reedies Have ESP?

What do we need to modify in the code to answer the question?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
guessing_samp_dist <- do(1000)*rflip(n = 329, prob = 0.25)

p_hat <- 106 / 329

ggplot(data = guessing_samp_dist, mapping = aes(x = prop)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_hat, color = "orange", size = 2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hypothesis Testing

**Big Idea:**

-   Make an assumption about the population **parameter**.

-   Generate a sampling distribution for a *test* statistic based on that assumption.

    -   Called a **null distribution**

-   See if the test statistic based on the observed sample aligns with the generated sampling distribution or not.

-   If it does, then we didn't learn much.

    -   (Didn't prove the parameter equals the assumed value but it is still plausible)

-   If it doesn't, then we have evidence that our assumption about the parameter was wrong.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ESP Example

**Big Idea:**

-   Make an assumption about the population parameter.
    -   Ex: ESP doesn't exist. p, probability of guessing correctly, equals 0.25.

### ESP Example

**Big Idea:**

::::: columns
::: column
-   See if the test statistic based on the observed sample aligns with the generated sampling distribution or not.
    -   Ex: It is in the center-ish of the distribution. It isn't an unusual value.
-   If it does, then we didn't learn much. (Didn't prove the parameter equals the assumed value but it is still plausible)
    -   It is still possible that ESP doesn't exist.
:::

::: column
```{r, echo = FALSE}
p_hat <- 0.26
# Graph the sampling distribution if guessing
ggplot(data = guessing_samp_dist, mapping = aes(x = prop)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 13, fill = "#A70E16") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_hat, color = "palegreen4", size = 2)
```

### ESP Example

::::: columns
::: column
**Big Idea:**

-   See if the test statistic based on the observed sample aligns with the generated sampling distribution or not.
    -   It is far in the tails of the distribution. It is an unusual value.
-   If it doesn't, then we have evidence that our assumption about the parameter was wrong.
    -   We have evidence ESP exists.

::: column
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Graph the sampling distribution if guessing
ggplot(data = guessing_samp_dist, mapping = aes(x = prop)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 13, fill = "#A70E16") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.32, color = "palegreen4", size = 2)
```

### Let's Take a Step Back from Our Last Statement...

::: nonincremental
-   Two important words in data analysis:

    -   Reproducibility
    -   Replicability
:::

-   **Reproducibility**: If I give you the raw data and my write-up, you will get to the exact same final numbers that I did.

    -   By using `Quarto` Documents, we are learning a **reproducible** workflow.

-   **Replicability**: If you follow my study design but collect new data (i.e. repeat my study on new subjects), you will come to the same conclusions that I did.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Replication Crisis

-   Science is going through a **replication crisis** right now.

    -   [In cancer science, many "discoveries" don't hold up](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-cancer-idUSBRE82R12P20120328)
    -   [Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716)
    -   [Psychology Is Starting To Deal With Its Replication Problem](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/psychology-is-starting-to-deal-with-its-replication-problem/)

-   And, sadly, **replication** studies of Bem and Honorton's ESP trials typically failed to find evidence of ESP.
