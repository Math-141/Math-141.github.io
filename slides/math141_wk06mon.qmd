# Probability Theory



## Random Processes and Events

**Probability Theory:** the study and quantification of uncertainty/randomness in outcomes of repeated experiments.

::: {.fragment}
A **random process** is one which we know what results *could* happen, but don't know which particular result *will* happen.

::: {.incremental}
-  Can be used to model processes that are complicated, but not truly random, to figure out how they work
-  Example: Rolling a 6-sided die
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
An **event** is a potential result of some particular random process.

::: {.incremental}
- Example: If we roll a 6-sided die, one event is *"the die rolls a 6"*. Another is *"the die rolls an odd number"*.
- The statement *"it will rain at 9am in Portland on 10/31"* is *an* event, but not one for the die-rolling process.
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Perception of Probability

We will soon define the word "probability." Before that, consider the following questions in small groups:

::: {.fragment}
1. When flipping a fair coin, we might say that "the probability of flipping Heads is 0.5." How do you interpret this sentence?
    a. If I flip this coin over and over, roughly 50% will be Heads.
    b. Heads and Tails are equally plausible.
    c. Both a and b make sense.
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. An election is coming up and a pollster claims "candidate A has a 0.9 probability of winning". How do you interpret this sentence?
    a. If we observe the election over and over, candidate A will win roughly 90% of the time.
    b. Candidate A is much more likely to win than to lose.
    c. Both a and b make sense.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Perception of Probability (Notes)

::: {.incremental}
- If you answered (a), you may naturally subscribe to the **"Frequentist"** view of probability (*long-run proportion*)
- If you answered (b), you may naturally subscribe to the **"Bayesian"** view of probability (*relative chance*)
- If you answered (c), you fall somewhere in between!
:::

::: {.fragment}
Neither definition is "correct". Statisticians are divided on how to interpret probability.

::: {.incremental}
- In this class, we'll discuss frequentist probability (see next slide)
- Grayson is (mostly) a Bayesian! Take Math 346 (Bayesian Statistics) to learn more!
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Probability

The "frequentist" (most common) definition of probability is...

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition: Probability
The **probability** of a particular event is the proportion of times the event would occur, if we observed the random process an *arbitrarily large* number of times.
:::

::: {.fragment}
To say that *a coin has 50% probability of landing heads*, means that...
  
::: {.incremental}
- In a large number of coin flips, we expect the proportion of heads to be close to 0.5
- This proportion should generally get closer to 0.5 as we do more and more flips
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
Since probabilities are defined as a proportion, **they will always be values between 0 and 1**.
:::

::: {.fragment}
For brevity, we'll represent statements like *the probability of the event "the coin lands heads" is 50%* using the notation:
$$
P(\textrm{Heads})=0.5 \quad \textrm{or} \quad P(H)=0.5
$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Law of Large Numbers

The probability of an event refers to the **long-run tendency of the proportion.**

::: {.incremental}
- Observed proportions can deviate from expected probabilities in a finite number of trials
- But as you conduct more and more trials, the deviation decreases
:::

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 10

set.seed(10)

n <- 2000
coins <- sample(c(0,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.5, .5))
total <- cumsum(coins)
lln <- tibble(flips = 1:n, total) %>% 
  mutate(prop = total/flips)

lln[1:200,] %>% filter(flips > 2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flips, y = prop)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(title = "Law of Large Numbers", 
       x = "Number of Flips", 
       y = "Proportion of Heads") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  ylim(.25, .75) + 
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2000, by = 200), limits = c(0, 2000))
```

::: {.fragment}
The proportion of heads deviates wildly from 0.5 during the first 200 flips
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Law of Large Numbers

The probability of an event refers to the **long-run tendency of the proportion.**


- Observed proportions can deviate from expected probabilities in a finite number of trials
- But as you conduct more and more trials, the deviation decreases


```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 10

lln[1:1000,] %>% filter(flips > 2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flips, y = prop)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(title = "Law of Large Numbers", 
       x = "Number of Flips", 
       y = "Proportion of Heads") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  ylim(.25, .75) + 
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2000, by = 200), limits = c(0, 2000))
```


The proportion of heads gets closer to 0.5 after 1000 flips


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Law of Large Numbers

- Observed proportions can deviate from expected probabilities in a finite number of trials

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4

       x = "Number of Flips",

  ylim(.25, .75) + 
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2000, by = 200), limits = c(0, 2000))
```


The proportion of heads is very close to 0.5 after 2000 flips!

This is the **Law of Large Numbers** in effect!

## Check Your Understanding

Suppose you're interested in winning the Powerball Jackpot, where the chance of winning is 1 in 292 million. You buy a single lottery ticket and wait to see if you won.

::: {.incremental}
1. When playing the lottery (a *random process*), what are the two possible outcomes (**events**)?

2. Write down the probability of your two events.

3. If you played the lottery 1 million times, should you **expect** to win? What about 292 million times?

4. If you played the lottery 1 billion times, are you **guaranteed** to win?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Check Your Understanding (Answers)

::: {.fragment}
1. When playing the lottery (a *random process*), what are the two possible outcomes (**events**)?
    - Winning and Losing
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. Write down the probability of your two events.
    - P(Winning) = 1/292,000,000
    - P(Losing) = 291,999,999/292,000,000 or 1 - P(Winning)
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. If you played the lottery 1 million times, should you **expect** to win? What about 292 million times?
    - By the Law of Large Numbers, you shouldn't *expect* to win after playing 1 million times. But you might win after playing 292 million times!
:::

::: {.fragment}
4. If you played the lottery 1 billion times, are you **guaranteed** to win?
    - You are *never guaranteed* to win! Each time you play, your chance of winning is so small!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Probability Models

We can formalize the connection between random processes/events with probabilities using a **Probability Model**

::: {.fragment}
A **probability model** has two components:

::: {.incremental}
1. A list of the possible results of a random process (called **events**) 
2. A rule (called the **probability function**) that assigns to each event a probability between 0 and 1, in a consistent manner.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Example: Probability Model for a Coin Toss:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Heads or Tails
2. $P(Heads) = 0.5$ and $P(Tails) = 0.5$
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
When discussing probability, we always (explicitly or implicitly) define a probability model.

- Probability models help us make sense of complex, random processes.

# Rules of Probability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Definition: Disjoint Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be **mutually exclusive** (or **disjoint**) if it is not possible for both to occur at the same time.

::: {.fragment}
**Example: Single Roll of a Die**

::: {.incremental}
- Let $A$ denote the event "a 1 is rolled on 6-sided die"
- Let $B$ denote the event "a 2 is rolled on 6-sided die"
- $A$ and $B$ are disjoint events for the random process
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Addition Rule

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Addition Rule
The probability that at least one event occurs in a pair of disjoint events is the sum of their individual probabilities:
$$
P(A \textrm{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Q:** When a die is rolled, what is the probability that an **odd number** is rolled?
:::

::: {.fragment}

$$
\begin{aligned}
P( \textrm{Odd} ) &= P(\textrm{roll a 1, 3, or 5})\\ 
&= P(\textrm{roll a 1}) + P(\textrm{roll a 3}) + P(\textrm{roll a 5})  && \text{(by the Addition Rule)}\\
&= \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \\
&= \frac{3}{6}
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Addition Rule: Only for Disjoint events!

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Addition Rule
The probability that at least one event occurs in a pair of disjoint events is the sum of their individual probabilities:
$$
P(A \textrm{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Q:** In a die-roll, what's the probability we get an even number?
:::

::: {.fragment}
- $P(\text{Even}) = P(\text{ Roll a 2, 4, or 6}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Q:** In a die-roll, what's the probability we get at least a 3?
:::

::: {.fragment}
- $P(\text{$\geq 3$}) = P(\text{ Roll a 3, 4, 5, or 6}) = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Q:** What's the probability you get an even number OR at least a 3?
:::

::: {.fragment}
- $P(\text{ Even OR $\geq 3$}) = P(\text{ Roll a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = \frac{5}{6}$
:::

::: {.fragment}
- But $P(\text{Even}) + P(\geq 3) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{6}$... that's not even between 0 and 1!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Complementary Events

The **complement** to an event $A$ (denoted $A^c$) is the event that occurs exactly when the original does not.

::: {.fragment}
- If $A$ is the event that a 1 is rolled on a die, then $A^c$ is the event that any other number (2,3,4,5, or 6) is rolled.
:::


::: {.fragment .callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Complement Rule
The probability that the complement of an event occurs is 1 minus the probability of the event:
$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
What is the probability that any number other than a 1 is rolled on a fair 6-sided die?

$$
P(\textrm{roll something other than a 1}) = 1 - P( \textrm{roll a 1}) = 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Check Your Understanding

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Addition Rule
The probability that at least one event occurs in a pair of disjoint events is the sum of their individual probabilities:
$$
P(A \textrm{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Complement Rule
The probability that the complement of an event occurs is 1 minus the probability of the event:
$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

In the city of Portland, there's rain on 60% of days and snow on 1% of days.

1. On a given day, what's the probability that it **doesn't rain?**

2. On a given day, what's the probability that it rains **OR** doesn't rain?

3. What if I told you it rains OR snows 61% of days in Portland. What's the **flaw** in my reasoning?

## Check Your Understanding (Answers)

In the city of Portland, there's rain on 60% of days and snow on 1% of days.

::: {.fragment}
1. On a given day, what's the probability that it **doesn't rain?**

$$P(\text{Doesn't Rain}) = P(\text{Rain}^c) = 1-P(\text{Rain}) = 1-0.6=0.4$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. On a given day, what's the probability that it rains **OR** doesn't rain?

$$P(\text{Rain or Doesn't Rain}) = P(\text{Rain}) + P(\text{Doesn't Rain}) = 0.6+0.4=1$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. What if I told you it rains OR snows 61% of days in Portland. What's the **flaw** in my reasoning?

It can rain *and* snow in one day! Thus, we *can't use the addition rule!*
