### Goals for Today

-   Discuss final exam logistics
-   Big picture of inference (and regression review)
-   But first....
    -  Faculty evaluations!

## Final exam info + logistics

::: {.incremental}

-   Our final will occur on during finals week. 
-   **Two components**: an in-person written exam, and an in-person oral exam
-   **Oral component** 
    -   To be completed on Monday or Tuesday of finals week (Dec 15 or 16), in Library 390 (my office). 
    -   No resources are allowed for the oral exam, except for your final exam review problems.
    -   Will include questions about the content of the final exam review problems, and/or conceptual/interpretive questions from the course generally. 
    -   10 minutes long (12 minute appointments for transition buffer). 
    -   Sign up for oral exam times are first come first serve. If you have extended time on exams, you must sign up for 2 consecutive slots. 
    -   Oral exam signup link is available on the course website.

## Final exam info + logistics

::: {.incremental}

-   **Written component** 
    -   Will occur in Vollum Lecture Hall, on Wednesday, December 17, from 6pm - 9pm.  
    -   The exam is **closed book/notes/resources**, except for the following materials: content on the course website, an 8.5"x11" "cheatsheet" (this must be on a physical peice of paper out but does not need to be handwritten). You can also use the `R` help files (for example, by running `?function_name` in the console).
    -   You have **3 hours** to complete the written component of the exam. You must use this time consecutively. 
    -   You may **not** collaborate or consult with others about the exam. You may not use generative AI or any resources outside of the ones listed above.

## (More) Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}

  drop_na(species, bill_length_mm) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm),
            number_of_penguins = n())
