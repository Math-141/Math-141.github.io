# Conditional Probability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 1: Coffee or Tea?

A survey was given to 100 Math 141 students in 2017. Some results are summarized below:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

|           | Coffee | Tea | total |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------|
| First-year| 7      | 10  | 17    |
| Sophomore | 25     | 20  | 45    |
| Junior    | 13     | 12  | 25    |
| Senior    | 8      | 5   | 13    |
| **total** | **53** | **47** | **100** |

## Conditional Probability

**Conditional Probability**: probability of something occurring, **given** that another event has **already** occurred.

::: {.fragment}
We write *the conditional probability of Event A given Event B has occurred* as, 

$$P(A\ | \ B)$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
In the previous example,

::: {.incremental}
- Question: What is the probability that a random *sophomore* preferred *coffee*?
- Event A: The student prefers coffee
- Event B: The student is a sophomore
- Answer: P(Coffee | Sophomore) = P(A|B)
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conditional Probability

How do we calculate conditional probabilities?

::: {.fragment}
$$
P(\text{Coffee} | \text{Sophomore} ) = \frac{P(\text{Sophomore and prefers Coffee})}{P(\text{Sophomore})}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
In general,

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Conditional Probability Rule
The Conditional Probability of an event $A$ given another event $B$ is
$$
P(A | B)= \frac{P(A \textrm{ and } B)}{P(B)}
$$
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Answers to Activity 1

- Event $A$: The student prefers coffee
- Event $B$: The student is a sophomore

::: {.fragment}
1. **Probability student prefers coffee:** $P(\text{Coffee}) = P(A) = \frac{53}{100}$
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. **Probability student is a sophomore:** $P(\text{Sophomore}) = P(B) = \frac{45}{100}$
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. **Probability student is a sophomore and prefers coffee:** $P(\text{Sophomore and Coffee}) = P(\text{A and B}) = \frac{25}{100}$
:::

::: {.fragment}
4. **Probability a random sophomore prefers coffee:** 
$$P(\text{A | B}) = \frac{P(\text{A and B})}{P(\text{B})} = \frac{25}{100}\Big/\frac{45}{100} = \frac{25}{45}$$

# Using Conditional Probability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using Conditional Probabilities...

In the next few slides, we're going to use the concept of conditional probability to explore 4 more concepts:

::: {.incremental}
1. Independence

2. Multiplication Rule

3. Law of Total Probability

4. Bayes' Rule
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Independence

We say two events are **independent** if knowing one occurs doesn't change the probability that another occurs.

::: {.fragment}
- For example, rolling a 3 on a die (*event A*) doesn't change the probability that it rains today (*event B*), so these two events are independent.
:::

::: {.fragment .callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Criteria for Independence
Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if
$$
P(A | B) = P(A) \quad \text{and} \quad P(B | A) = P(B)
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Q:** Are the events "preferring coffee" (A) and "being a sophomore at Reed" (B) independent?
:::

::: {.fragment}
No! That's because $P(A)=\frac{53}{100}$ and $P(A|B)=\frac{25}{45}$, so $P(A)\neq P(A|B)$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Multiplication Rule

What if we want to know the probability that two events **both** occur?

::: {.fragment}
Rearrange our formula for conditional probability!


\begin{align}
    P(A | B)&= \frac{P(A \textrm{ and } B)}{P(B)}   \\
    \implies  P(A | B) P(B) &= P(A \textrm{ and } B) 
  \end{align}

:::

::: {.fragment .callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Multiplication Rule
For any events $A$ and $B$,
$$
P(A \textrm{ and } B ) = P(A|B) \times P(B)
$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Multiplication Rule

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Multiplication Rule
For any events $A$ and $B$,
$$
P(A \textrm{ and } B ) = P(A|B) \times P(B)
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
In the previous example...

- Event $A$: The student prefers coffee
- Event $B$: The student is a sophomore
:::

::: {.fragment}
and

- $P(B) = \frac{45}{100}$
- $P(A|B) = \frac{25}{45}$
- $P(A \ \text{and} \ B) = \frac{25}{100}$
:::

::: {.fragment}
Does it work?

$$ P(A|B) P(B) = (\frac{25}{45}) (\frac{45}{100}) = \frac{25}{100}$$

Checks out!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Law of Total Probability

Consider two events:

- Event $A$: The student prefers coffee
- Event $B$: The student is a sophomore

::: {.fragment}
In this scenario, notice for any student who prefers coffee ($A$), it's possible...

::: {.incremental}
- they're a sophomore ($B$)
- they're **not** a sophomore ($B^c$)
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
Thus,
$$
\begin{align}
P(A) &= P(A\text{ and }B) + P(A\text{ and }B^c) \tag{Addition Rule}\\
&=P(A | B)P(B) + P(A|B^c)P(B^c) \tag{Multiplication Rule}
\end{align}
$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Law of Total Probability

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: The Law of Total Probability
Let $A$ and $B$ be events. Then
$$
P(A) = P(A  | B)P(B) + P(A  | B^c)P(B^c) 
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
- The Law of Total Probability is useful when finding "overall" probabilities when we only have the "pieces".
- We'll see a real-world example next!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Patient Health

Suppose you're a medical researcher interested in population health.

::: {.fragment}
- 80% of individuals *see a physician* each year
- 20% do not
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Among people who see a physician, 95% are generally healthy.
- Among people who *don't see* a physician, 70% are generally healthy.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Q:** What proportion of adults are generally healthy?
:::

::: {.fragment}
Let

- Event $A$: Individual is healthy
- Event $B$: Individual sees a physician each year
- Event: $B^c$: Individual doesn't see a physician each year
:::

::: {.fragment}
This question is asking: **$P(A)=$???**
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Patient Health

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: The Law of Total Probability
Let $A$ and $B$ be events. Then
$$
P(A) = P(A  | B)P(B) + P(A  | B^c)P(B^c) 
$$
:::

We want to answer $P(\text{Healthy})$.

::: {.fragment}
Note that,

$$
\begin{align}
P(\text{Healthy}) &= P(\text{Healthy}|\text{Doctor})P(\text{Doctor})+P(\text{Healthy}|\text{Doctor}^c)P(\text{Doctor}^c)\\
&= P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|B^c)P(B^c)\\
&= (.95)(.80) + (.70)(.20)\\
&= 0.90
\end{align}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
Thus, 90% of adults are generally healthy!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bayes' Rule

What if we know $P(B|A)$, but we want to know $P(A|B)$?

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem: Bayes' Rule
Let $A$ and $B$ be events. Then,
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B  | A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Proof:** From the definition of multiplication rule,
$$
\begin{align}
P(A \text{ and } B) &= P(A|B)\times P(B)\\
P(A \text{ and } B) &= P(B|A)\times P(A)
\end{align}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
Setting these two equations equal, we find
$$
\begin{align}
P(A|B)\times P(B) &= P(B|A)\times P(A)\\
\implies P(A|B) &= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\end{align}
$$

## Activity 2: Testing for a Rare Disease

Suppose that we have a rapid COVID-19 test that:

::: {.incremental}
- Given a person **does not** have COVID, the test is (correctly) negative 99% of the time.
- Given a person **does** have COVID, the test is (correctly) positive 80% of the time.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Assume that the overall prevalence of COVID at the time of the test was 1%.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Q:** Suppose a person takes this test and receives a positive diagnosis -- **what is the probability that the person has COVID?**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Hint 1**: Write this out in terms of a conditional probability
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Hint 2**: Define events $A$ or $B$ in this setting (as well as $A^c$ and $B^c$)
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Hint 3**: Write out all the info here in terms of probabilities and events $A$ and $B$.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Hint 4**: Start with Bayes' Rule! You'll also need the Law of Total Probability!

## Activity 2: Solution

**Q:** Suppose a person takes this test and receives a positive diagnosis -- what is the probability that the person has COVID?

::: {.fragment}
- This is asking for $P(\text{Have Covid} \ | \ \text{Positive Test})$
:::

::: {.fragment}
- $A$ = Has COVID,  $A^c$ = No COVID,  $B$ = Positive Test,  $B^c$ = Negative Test
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Express what we know using probability language...
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2: Solution {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

- Test correctly diagnoses a person who **does not** have COVID 99% of the time  
  $P(B^c | A^c) = 0.99$ and $P(B | A^c) = 0.01$

- Test correctly diagnoses a patient who **does** have COVID 80% of the time.  
  $P(B | A) = 0.80$ and $P(B^c | A) = 0.20$

- The overall prevalence of COVID at the time of the test was 1%.  
  $P(A) = 0.01$ and $P(A^c) = 0.99$

:::

::: {.fragment}

Bayes' Rule:

$$
P (A  | B) = P(B | A) \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 0.80 * \frac{0.01}{P(B)=\text{???}}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}

Law of Total Probability:

$$
P (B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c) = 0.80(0.01) + 0.01(0.99) = 0.0179 
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}

Combining the above:

$$
\implies P (A  | B) = 0.80 * \frac{0.01}{0.0179} \approx \boxed{0.447}
$$
