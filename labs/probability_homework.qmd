## Problem 1

![](img/dog-pants.png)

Students in a prior semester of Math 141 were asked two questions as part of a larger survey: "Are hot dogs sandwiches?" and "If dogs wore pants, would they wear them on their front legs, back legs, or on all four legs"? A summary of responses for 70 students is given below:

|             | Hotdog is a sandwich | Hotdog is not a sandwich |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Front legs  |         1            |             1             |
| Back legs   |        17            |            26             |
| All 4 legs  |         9            |            16             |

Suppose we randomly choose 1 student who completed this survey.

a. Are the events "the student thinks a hotdog is not a sandwich" and "the student thinks dogs should wear pants on their back legs" mutually exclusive?

b. What is the probability that the randomly chosen student thinks a hotdog is a sandwich?

c. What is the probability that the randomly chosen student thinks a hotdog is a sandwich and thinks that dogs should wear pants on all 4 legs?

d. What is the probability that the randomly chosen student thinks a hotdog is a sandwich given that the student thinks dogs should wear pants on all 4 legs?

e. Is the event "the student thinks a hotdog is a sandwich" *independent* (in the statistical sense) of the event "the student thinks dogs should wear pants on their front legs"? Explain your reasoning.


## Problem 2

Suppose A and B are events with P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.7.

a. Is it always possible to compute P(A and B), if you *only* know P(A) and P(B) and nothing else?

b. Assuming that events A and B arise from independent random processes, find P(A and B) and P(A | B).
  
c. Suppose we are given that P(A and B) = 0.1. Are events A and B independent? Explain.

d. If we are given that P(A and B) = 0.1 , what is P(A | B)?



## Problem 3

Lupus is a medical phenomenon where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead see plasma proteins as foreign bodies, leading to a high risk of blood clotting. It is believed that 2% of the population suffer from this disease. The test is 98% accurate if a person actually has the disease. The test is 74% accurate if a person does not have the disease. There is a line from the Fox television show *House* that is often used after a patient tests positive for lupus: "It's never lupus." Do you think there is truth to this statement? Use appropriate probabilities to support your answer. (Hint: Bayes' Law will be helpful!)
