    "text": "Learning Outcomes\nIn this course, you will learn how to think critically with data by engaging in the entire data analysis process. While most of our time will be spent learning techniques related to the Exploration and Visualization step and the Modeling and Inference step, you will also practice the other important components of analyzing data. Furthermore, since computation is an integral part of modern statistical work, you will learn to write R code – leveraging the RStudio user interface – to analyze data and will become familiar with several tidyverse R packages. You will also develop a reproducible and shareable workflow by using Quarto documents for all analyses.\nBy the end of the course, you will have improved your data acumen and your ability to think statistically. More concretely, you will be better able to accomplish the following tasks, which have been broken down by steps of the data analysis workflow:\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion formulation:\n\nTranslate a research problem into a set of questions that can be answered with data.\nFormulate data questions as measurable statements about parameters in a model.\n\nData acquisition:\n\nDetermine the necessary data to conduct analyses.\nReflect on how design structures and data collection impact potential conclusions.\nIdentify potential ethical concerns surrounding data collection and data privacy.\n\nData wrangling:\n\nExplore datasets to determine what wrangling may be required (e.g., removing missing values, filtering out variables or observations, collapsing categories of a categorical variable).\nApply basic data wrangling operations.\n\nExploration and Visualization:\n\nUnderstand key principles of designing and creating effective data visualizations.\nMaster creating graphs and drawing sound conclusions from graphs.\nCompute and interpret summary statistics.\n\nModeling and Inference:\n\nUnderstand and be able to explain key probabilistic and inferential concepts, such as, sampling, variability, random variables, distributions, confidence, and significance.\nDetermine the correct model for a given problem and set of data.\nAppropriately apply and draw inferences from a statistical model, including quantifying and interpreting the uncertainty in model estimates.\nConsider the ethical implications of various modeling practices.\n\nCommunicating Findings:\n\nDevelop a reproducible workflow using Quarto documents.\nInterpret and communicate results of statistical analyses effectively for both a statistical and a non-statistical audience.\nBe able to reflect on the data involved in an analysis and show a curiosity for other ways of examining and thinking about the data."

In particular:\n\nLab assignments:\n\nAlmost every week, we will have a lab assignment. The lab assignments will be assigned on Thursday at lab time and due the following week on Thursday at 9:00am.\nLab assignments will include both computational and theoretical questions.\nThese lab assignments will be turned in via Gradescope.\nTo help with various circumstances (expected and unexpected), you have up to 4 additional extensions days that you can use as you need (e.g., 1 additional day for 4 labs, 4 additional days for 1 lab, …) but the extension days must be rounded up to the nearest day (e.g., 2 extra hours = 1 extension day). If you need to use any extension days, send Grayson an email (not a Slack message) with the title: “Math 141 Extension Days” that includes the lab number you are using an extension for, and the number of day(s) used.\n\nHomework assignments:\n\nFor most lecture class periods, along with the assigned reading, I will assign a short set of homework questions related to the reading to be turned in at the beginning of class.\nThese will be turned in by you in person, as a hard copy, at the beginning of class. If you arrive to class late, please wait until the end of class to turn in your answers.\nNo late homework assignments are accepted, but up to three missed homework assignments will be dropped from your final grade.\n\nIn-class activities:\n\nDuring lecture and lab, we will include some in-class activities. Including but not limited to:\n\ngroup activities,\nindependent activities,\nlow-stakes quizzes.\n\n\nExams:\n\nWe’ll have a midterm exam and final exam for this course. Each exam will have a written take-home component and an in-person oral component.\nThe written component of the midterm exam will be released on Monday 10/12 and will be due by Wednesday 10/14. The oral component of the midterm exam will occur on Thursday 10/15 and Friday 10/16.\nThe written component of the final exam will be released on Wednesday 12/7, the last day of classes, and will be due at the end of reading week. The oral component of the final exam will occur during finals week.\nNo late exams are accepted."

Therefore, I encourage you to collaborate on assignments but every piece of work you do must be your own. Copying and pasting other people’s work or code is not acceptable. The Honor Principle must guide your conduct in this class.\nIf you choose to collaborate with a classmate, you must add their name to the top of your assignment, and list them as a collaborator, e.g.:\nCollaborator(s): Elliot Shannon, Romain Boutelet\nBut what is collaboration?:\nFor Math 141, collaboration can look like: working with classmates together on a given problem, doing scratch work, helping each other get un-stuck on a part of a problem, and even coming to a solution. However, you must write up your own problem solutions individually and cannot copy other’s solutions (even those who you have collaborated with). Further, copying code from a collaborator, classmate, or generative AI tool (see the following section) is strictly prohibited.\nAI Policy:\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Co-Pilot, Gemini, and others are being used to generate code, analyze data, and much more. However, learning to think critically about a problem at hand, and engaging with your peers, tutors, and instructors when not understanding a concept or question are integral components of a liberal arts education. Further, a key goal of this course is for you to learn how to thoughtfully, ethically, and independently extract knowledge from data and engage in statistical reasoning. Therefore, the use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and others, are strictly prohibited in any stage of the work process for this course. If you have questions about whether a tool is allowed for this course, ask the Instructor before using it."

They’re also a great place to get help on problems that you are stuck on.\nCourse Assistant office hours are a great place to work on your assignments with fellow students and seek the help of the course assistants whenever you get stuck.\nFurther, each Reed student is entitled to one hour of individual tutoring per course per week. You can sign up for individual tutoring in iris.\nBelow is the schedule of office hours for the week. We will update this calendar in case office hours need to change times or locations."

Here, we detail the process of logging in to the RStudio Server and “cloning” a GitHub repository to get the lab materials. “Cloning”, in this case, means making a copy of my a folder I’ve uploaded with all files and data needed so that you can complete the lab. Anyways, here are the steps:\n\nUse your web browser to navigate to the Reed RStudio server at https://rstudio.reed.edu.\nLog-in using your Reed username and password (the one you use for Moodle, Gmail, etc.).\nIn the Projects dropdown (typically upper right) of RStudio, click the “Project: (None)” button1. Then, click “New Project…”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting “New Project…”\n\n\n\n\n\nA pop-up will appear to ask how you’d like to create the project. You’ll need to click “Version Control” and the “Git” to access the lab materials. After you’ve clicked “Version Control” and “Git”, add the link to the lab materials in the “Repository URL” section:2\nhttps://github.com/Math-141/lab01.git\nFinally, give the Project Directory the name “lab01”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Version Control from the pop-up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow things should look after you’ve added the link and project name\n\n\n\n\n\nPress “Create Project”. If all has gone well, you should see “lab01” in the top right corner of RStudio, and some new files for the lab in the bottom right corner of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Create Project button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA successful cloning of the lab!\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen lab01_yourname.qmd. This is the Quarto document that you’ll complete the lab in. You can (and should) rename this file to include your actual name by checking the box next to the file, clicking “Rename”, and modifying the text to include your name, e.g. lab01_graysonwhite.qmd, rather than lab01_yourname.qmd.\n\nWe’ve also provided a gif of steps 3-6 to help minimize confusion in these steps:\n\n\n\nSteps 3-6, via gif"
