    "text": "Collaboration Policy for Math 141\nWorking with your classmates on difficult and interesting problems can not only help your learning, but help you get to know each other. Therefore, we allow and encourage collaboration on lab reports, homework assignments, and lecture tickets. However, collaboration on exams and quizzes is strictly prohibited and will be considered academic misconduct.\nIf you choose to collaborate with a classmate, please add their name to the top of your assignment, and list them as a collaborator, e.g.:\nCollaborator(s): Elliot Shannon, Romain Boutelet\nBut what is collaboration?\nFor Math 141, collaboration can look like: working with classmates together on a given problem, doing scratch work, helping each other get un-stuck on a part of a problem, and even coming to a solution. However, you must write up your own problem solutions individually and cannot copy other’s solutions (even those who you have collaborated with). Further, copying code from a collaborator, classmate, or generative AI tool (see the following section) is strictly prohibited and will be considered academic misconduct."

However, learning to think critically about a problem at hand, and engaging with your peers, tutors, and instructors when not understanding a concept or question are integral components of a liberal arts education. Further, a key goal of this course is for you to learn how to thoughtfully, ethically, and independently extract knowledge from data and engage in statistical reasoning. Therefore, the use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and others, are strictly prohibited in any stage of the work process for this course. If you have questions about whether a tool is allowed for this course, ask the Instructor before using it.\nViolations of this policy are considered academic misconduct."

For each component, your group will submit one document via D2L.\n\nThe group member submission\nDue date: Tuesday, November 12th, 5pm.\nPlease submit a document to D2L with the names of your group members. Remember, groups of 3-5 people are allowed. If you are having trouble finding a group or your group is too small (&lt; 3 people), please let Grayson know and we will combine you or your group with others.\n\n\nThe proposal\nDue date: Saturday, November 23rd, 5pm.\nPlease submit a brief proposal of the project you would like to do. This should be a (no longer than 2 page) document outlining the data you will use and an idea of the story or information that you’d like to try to extract from the data. For this part, it is strongly recommended that you download the data you would like to use and take a look at it. In the proposal, describe any challenges you anticipate having working with the data, and the steps needed to get the data into a form that will be easy to work with in R. It is expected that this document is well-written, explains the data you’d like to work with, and conveys your ideas and hopes for what you’d like to do with the data (i.e. what your blog post will be about).\n\n\nThe blog post\nDue date: Monday, December 9th, 5pm.\nThe blog post is the heart of the final project. You and your group members will write a blog post in a Quarto document that takes the raw data you are using and tells a story with it. The blog post will include the story of getting the data, wrangling the data, and plots and summaries of the data. The blog posts will be posted on the course website (with groups permission), you have the right to not include your blog post on the course website, or to anonymize your blog post for the course website.\nThe blog post has the following parameters:\n\nI expect the post to be approximately 1000 words. This is a “soft” minimum: i.e., I wouldn’t want to see a significantly shorter blog post, and it would be fine if you went significantly over this limit. In general, I want your blog post to convey the story you are telling in a thoughtful way that doesn’t have too much “fluff” but isn’t overly terse either. In other words, write naturally and thoughtfully.\nYour blog post should include at least three (3) graphics created with ggplot2 and at least one tabular summary of the data. For displaying tables in beautiful ways in your blog post, check out the gt R package.\nYour blog post will be written in Quarto as a fully reproducible document. You will load in the data and necessary packages at the beginning of the blog post, do the necessary wrangling and cleaning in the blog post, and make the plots in the blog post. It is okay (and even encouraged) to work in separate documents to begin, but one final blog post will be the final product.\nYou likely should break your blog post into different sections. I suggest (but surely do not limit you to) the following sections:\n\nIntroduction: Give some background on the data and the questions you’d like to answer with it,\nMethods: Include how you got the data, and the steps necessary to load it into R and wrangle it into appropriate format for data analysis,\nAnalysis / Results: Talk about and display your figures, tables, and findings from the data,\nConclusions: Summarize your findings and discuss the implications. Discuss possible future directions for working with these data.\n\nYour blog post will Render to HTML. You must submit your .qmd file, along with any data files (.csv, etc.) necessary for Rendering the document to D2L by the deadline, December 9th at 5pm.\n\n\n\nThe presentation\nDue date: Slides submitted by Wednesday, December 11th, 5pm. Presentations to be completed in class during the final exam slot on December 12th.\nYou and your group will present the results from your analyses (i.e. findings from the blog post) in slide show form to your classmates during the final exam slot. Groups will present together, and presentation time should be shared relatively equally between group members.\nMore details to come on the presentation."
