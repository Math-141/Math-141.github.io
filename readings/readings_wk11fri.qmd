## Reading 

Before coming to lecture today, please read the following material: 

-   MD 10.1 - 10.3 (feel free to skim 10.1 as a refersher on SLR, but read 10.2 and 10.3 closely)

## Homework Assignment

After you've completed the reading, but before coming to class, please complete the following homework assignment. Bring your responses to this assignment (handwritten or typed) to class on a piece of paper: 

We're interested in average weight of cheese blocks, $\mu$, at the Tillamook factory. Suppose we've observed the following data:

- We collect an SRS of $n=40$ cheese blocks, and find 
- $\bar{x} = 16.5$ grams and 
- $s = 2$ grams.

Given these data, create a 90\% confidence interval for $\mu$. Show your work.
