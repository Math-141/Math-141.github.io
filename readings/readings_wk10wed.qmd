## Homework Assignment

After you've completed the reading, but before coming to class, please complete the following homework assignment. Bring your responses to this assignment (handwritten or typed) to class on a piece of paper: 

Suppose 4 students have still not received their graded Math 141 midterm (yes, let's pretend we actually had a hand-written midterm) and that I hand back the exams randomly to each student. Let X = the number of students who get their correct exam.

-   Let's say the student's names are A(licia), B(ob), C(olin), and D(onna) and they are sitting in a row ABCD. One possible outcome is ABDC (1st exam goes to A, 2nd to B, 3rd to D, 4th to C). In that case, what does X equal?

-   List out all possible outcomes. And for each outcome, determine what X equals.

-   Why is P(X = 3) = 0?

-   Write out the probability distribution for X.

-   Determine the mean value of X.

-   Determine the standard deviation of X.

-   What is the probability that at least one student gets their correct exam?
