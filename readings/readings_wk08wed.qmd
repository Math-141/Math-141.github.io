After you've completed the reading, but before coming to class, please complete the following homework assignment. Bring your responses to this assignment (handwritten or typed) to class on a piece of paper: 

We'd like to estimate the average height of Reedies. Pretend we've taken a random sample of 20 Reedies and measured their height. We get a point estimate of 66.5 inches, and, after bootstrapping, a 95% confidence interval of (63.0, 70.0).

-   What is our parameter of interest? 
-   If we were to create an 80% confidence interval would it be wider or narrower than the 95% confidence interval we reported? Explain your answer. 
-   Interpret the 95% confidence interval in the context of the data.
