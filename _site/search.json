The course serves as an introduction to exploratory data analysis (EDA) using spreadsheet software and the R programming language. Use of R focuses on cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data to facilitate EDA. The course is designed as a general precursor for subsequent discipline-specific courses. Learning occurs in a hands-on active environment with topics motivated using real datasets from environmental and biological sciences."

    "text": "AI Policy for FOR 128\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, are being used to generate code, analyze data, and much more. However, a key goal of this course is for you to learn how to thoughtfully, ethically, and independently write code and extract knowledge from data. Therefore, the use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and others, are strictly prohibited in any stage of the work process for this course. If you have questions about whether a tool is allowed for this course, ask the Instructor before using it.\nViolations of this policy are considered academic misconduct."
