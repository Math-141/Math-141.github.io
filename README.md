This repository contains source code for the course website for Math 141: Introduction to Probability and Statistics at Reed College, Fall 2025.

The website was created with Quarto. Much inspiration, styling, and formatting was drawn from UC Berkeley's [Stat 20 website](https://www.stat20.org/) (thanks Andrew + Stat 20 team).
